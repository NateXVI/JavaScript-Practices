# JavaScript-Practices

Just some random programs I have written to practice JavaScript. These practices are sometimes based of The Coding Trains's (YouTube channel) coding challenges. I highly recommend if you are just getting started with programming, like me, to start with the P5.js library and follow The Coding Trains videos. It's super easy to get stared and is all online.

Please let me know if there's any way you see I can improve my code. I really want efficient and clean code.
